1. Crop yield estimation and prediction

Hu, H., Wang, C., Deng, X., Wang, K., & Liang, D. (2018). Estimating crop yields using deep learning and multi-spectral satellite imagery. Remote Sensing, 10(10), 1560.

In "Estimating crop yields using deep learning and multi-spectral satellite imagery" by Hu et al. (2018), the authors use deep learning techniques to estimate crop yield using multi-spectral satellite imagery. The authors compare different deep learning models and show that a convolutional neural network with residual connections performed the best. They also show that their model outperformed traditional crop yield estimation methods, demonstrating the potential of computer vision techniques for improving crop yield estimation and prediction.

2. Soil moisture mapping and analysis

Mu, Tianhao, Guiwei Liu, Xiguang Yang, and Ying Yu. 2023. "Soil-Moisture Estimation Based on Multiple-Source Remote-Sensing Images" Remote Sensing 15, no. 1: 139. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15010139

The authors combine data from synthetic aperture radar (SAR), optical sensors, and meteorological stations to improve soil moisture estimation accuracy. They use a support vector regression (SVR) algorithm to model the relationship between soil moisture and the remote sensing data. The authors validate their method using field measurements and show that their approach outperforms traditional methods for soil moisture estimation. The article provides insights into the potential of combining multiple data sources for improving soil moisture estimation accuracy using machine learning algorithms.

3. Land-use and land-cover change detection

Vali, Ava & Comai, Sara & Matteucci, Matteo. (2020). Deep Learning for Land Use and Land Cover Classification Based on Hyperspectral and Multispectral Earth Observation Data: A Review. Remote Sensing. 12. 2495. 10.3390/rs12152495. 

In this paper, Vali et al. provide a review of the use of deep learning techniques for land use and land cover classification based on hyperspectral and multispectral Earth observation data. The authors discuss the challenges associated with traditional classification techniques and highlight the potential of deep learning in improving the accuracy and efficiency of land use and land cover classification. The paper provides an overview of different deep learning models used in land use and land cover classification and discusses the advantages and limitations of these models. The authors also identify future research directions for the use of deep learning in land use and land cover classification.
